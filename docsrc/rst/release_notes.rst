Release Notes
=============


1.1 (July 2018)
---------------
Introduces new features:

* **Multiple activities**: ROOT can now optimize locations for more than one class of activity in the same analysis.
* **Combined factor and constraint formulas**: Users can now use mathematical formulas to define new factors (objectives or constraints) from those provided by the raster and shapefile inputs. Previously new factors could only be created by multiplying.
* **Custom SDU shapefiles**: ROOT now provides users the option of providing their own spatial decision unit shapefile to use in place of a regular grid.
* **Specific weight optimizations**: Users can run a set of optimization analyses with specific weights on sub-objectives by providing a table listing the desired weights.
* **Input validation**: Inspects input tables and provides specific error messages.
* **Other**: Various naming changes to make terminology and field names more consistent.
